Iplementing continuous integration and deployment with zero-downtime deployments and automated rollback capabilities. This project demonstrates modern DevOps practices including containerization, infrastructure automation, and cloud deployment.
Key Achievements

✅ 70% Faster Deployments - Reduced deployment time from hours to minutes
✅ Zero-Downtime Deployments - Seamless updates with no service interruption
✅ Automated Rollback - Instant recovery from failed deployments
✅ 100% Automated - From code commit to production deployment

🔧 Features
1. Automated CI/CD Pipeline

Automatically triggered on GitHub push
Complete build, test, and deployment cycle
No manual intervention required

2. Docker Containerization

Consistent deployment across environments
Isolated application runtime
Easy scaling and portability

3. Zero-Downtime Deployments

Rolling update strategy
Health checks before traffic routing
Seamless user experience during updates

4. Automated Rollback

Automatic failure detection
Instant rollback to previous stable version
Minimized downtime in case of issues

5. Infrastructure as Code

Jenkinsfile defines entire pipeline
Reproducible deployments
Version-controlled infrastructure

📊 Pipeline Stages
Stage 1: Checkout
groovy- Clones latest code from GitHub
- Ensures working with most recent version
Stage 2: Build Docker Image
groovy- Creates Docker container image
- Tags with build number and 'latest'
- Optimized multi-layer caching
Stage 3: Run Tests
groovy- Executes automated test suite
- Validates code quality
- Fails pipeline if tests fail
Stage 4: Push to ECR
groovy- Authenticates with Amazon ECR
- Pushes Docker image to registry
- Makes image available for deployment
Stage 5: Deploy to ECS
groovy- Updates task definition with new image
- Triggers ECS service update
- Implements rolling deployment strategy
Stage 6: Wait for Deployment
groovy- Monitors deployment progress
- Waits for service stability
- Ensures deployment completion
Stage 7: Health Check
groovy- Retrieves public IP of deployed container
- Tests application health endpoint
- Verifies successful deployment
- Provides access URL
Stage 8: Rollback (On Failure)
groovy- Detects deployment failures
- Automatically reverts to previous version
- Maintains service availability
🛠️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

AWS Account (Free Tier eligible)
GitHub Account
Basic understanding of command line

1. Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/Khanrukku/devops-pipeline-project.git
cd devops-pipeline-project
2. AWS Setup
bash# Create ECR repository
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name devops-pipeline-app --region us-east-1

# Create ECS cluster
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name devops-pipeline-cluster
3. Jenkins Configuration
bash# Launch EC2 instance (t2.micro)
# Install Jenkins, Docker, AWS CLI
# Configure Jenkins with required plugins
4. Configure GitHub Webhook
bash# Add webhook URL: http://YOUR_JENKINS_IP:8080/github-webhook/
# Set content type: application/json
# Select: Just the push event
5. Deploy
bash# Push code to GitHub
git push origin main

# Jenkins automatically builds and deploys
# Check Jenkins console for deployment status

🐛 Troubleshooting
Pipeline Fails at Build Stage
bash# Check Docker service
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
Cannot Connect to ECR
bash# Verify AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1
Health Check Fails
bash# Check security group rules
# Verify port 3000 is open
# Check ECS task logs in CloudWatch
